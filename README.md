A high-fidelity Python toolkit for interplanetary trajectory analysis, optimization, and mission design. This repository provides advanced tools ranging from N-body propagation to symbolic optimal control solvers and global launch window scans.

## 🚀 Key Features

### 🔭 High-Fidelity Dynamics
-   **N-Body Propagator**: Full numerical integration using SPICE ephemeris data (Sun, Planets, Moon).
-   **Perturbations**: Realistic force models including Solar Radiation Pressure (SRP), Atmospheric Drag, and J2 Zonal Harmonics.
    -   *Note: J2 gravity requires SPICE kernels with specific body constants (e.g., `J2E` for Earth).*
-   **Variational Equations**: Automatic State Transition Matrix (STM) propagation for navigation and optimization.

### 🛠️ Mission Design & Targeting
-   **B-Plane Targeting**: Precise targeting of gravity assist flyby parameters (B·R, B·T).
-   **Lambert Solver**: Robust solution of the two-body boundary value problem (Gauss method).
-   **Porkchop Plotter**: Global launch window analysis identifying C3 energy and Time-of-Flight (TOF) optima.
-   **Tisserand Analysis**: Visualizing gravity assist opportunities and energy changes between bodies.

### 📊 Advanced Optimization
This toolkit provides multiple pathways for solving trajectory optimization problems:
-   **Symbolic Indirect Methods**: Transform Optimal Control Problems (OCP) into TPBVPs via Pontryagin's Minimum Principle with automated symbolic derivation.
-   **Numerical Shooting Methods**:
    *   **Single Shooting**: Fast convergence for well-behaved boundary value problems.
    *   **Multiple Shooting**: Robust solving of sensitive trajectories by breaking them into segments (purely numerical implementation).
-   **Direct Collocation**: Solving OCPs via Hermite-Simpson discretization of the state and control paths.
-   **Smoothing Homotopy**: Robustly transitioning from Minimum Energy to Minimum Fuel problems using continuation methods.

## 🛠️ Installation & Setup

### 1. Clone & Install
```bash
git clone https://github.com/BatuhanAkkova/deep-space-mission-design-toolkit.git
cd deep-space-mission-design-toolkit
pip install -e .
```

### 2. SPICE Kernels
This toolkit requires SPICE kernels. Place your `.bsp`, `.tpc`, and `.tls` files in the `data/` directory. 
Recommended kernels:
- `de440.bsp` (Planetary Ephemeris)
- `naif0012.tls` (Leaperseconds)
- `pck00010.tpc` (Planetary Constants)

## 📐 Mission Design Conventions

All calculations follow strict astrodynamics standards:
-   **Time System**: Barycentric Dynamical Time (TDB) / Ephemeris Time (ET).
-   **Coordinate Frames**: `ECLIPJ2000` (Ecliptic) for interplanetary, `J2000` (Equatorial) for near-Earth.
-   **Units**: SI-based with **Kilometers (km)** and **km/s** as standard for SPICE compatibility.
-   **Assumptions**: Patched-conic results are routinely validated against full N-body numerical integration.
